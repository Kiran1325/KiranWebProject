            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Web Development means the building and maintenance of websites.It is the creation of dynamic Web application. Web Pages are made by HTML,CSS,Javascript. I started learning HTML and CSS since the day i got admitted in this
                college. The Burning Curosity of learning HTML CSS coding has lead me to join NAMI college,dream to become Software Developer and This could be successful only with the help of my module teachers . As this assignment was
                given to us as an first term test . facing errors and problem was common but my respected sir Mr Ankit Thapa helps me during this period by taking online classes .
            </p>

            <p>
                In this course of doing Assignment I had some errors in Menu Bar, In responsive view Ham Burger icon was not working on click but menu bar was hiding inside ham burger that's why small use of javascript can be seen at the
                end of the each html pages . The task given by the college was Index , Portfolio,CV,Contactand Report pages.The Design of the Page are My own and I took some knowledge from w3school.Although While doing the project I learned
                many more thinks about How to make Website and to use code which I had learn from my classes.
